# Walk & Talk

See my site here: https://maebhnighuairim.github.io/p1-walk-and-talk/

## Introduction:
I find that getting out and moving is great for my mental health, and so when I saw mental health as a project topic, I knew exactly what I wanted to do. Mental health is a serious issue, and often needs medical and professional intervention, but I believe it’s important not to underestimate the importance of community and activity when treating mental health. So my project is for a local walking group who get together weekly to enjoy some fresh air and conversation.

There is no wireframe for the thank you page.


## Design

### Colours:
I chose to focus on the colour green as it is reminiscent of nature and calmness. A deep forest green was my main colour, and I used softer variations across the rest of the pages.

### Typography

I used Google Fonts to customise my fonts across the website. In particular, I used [Sen](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Sen)  and [Edu VIC WA NT Beginner](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Edu+VIC+WA+NT+Beginner). I used the second font mainly for Headings, in all caps, and Sen for the rest of the text.

### Imagery 

I used a mixture of real images and cartoons. I used images that I believe would inspire the user to join the group. The hero image is a group of people walking together towards a clearing in the forest, which is lighter than the darkness of the forest behind. The forest itself is calming too - I instantly want to be trasnported there to be mindful.

Images used in the bootstrap cards are indicative of each benefit proposed in the cards. 

I used cartoons in the landing page to break up walls of text and to have a friendly tone to the text.

I used photos of happy people on walks as images of previous walks. It was important to show diversity in all forms in these photos - all are welcome.


## Page Features

### Navbar 
The responsive navbar features links to Home, About, and Contact Us, designed for both desktop and mobile views. On larger screens, the links are displayed horizontally, while on smaller devices, they collapse into a hamburger menu that expands to show the links vertically when clicked. The navbar has a clean background with contrasting text colors, providing visual feedback on hover. It includes a logo on the left that serves as a home link and is structured to be accessible for all users, ensuring a smooth and user-friendly navigation experience across devices.


### Hero-Image 
Choosing a picture of a group walking through a forest as a hero image for a walking group beautifully captures the essence of community, health, and nature. When looking at the image, I want the visit to envision themselves as part of this uplifting experience, inspiring them to join the group.


### Tagline - “empowering you to get out and talk about mental health”
This tagline is core to the main aims of Walk & Talk - getting a group of people together, out in nature and having a chat. The tagline appeals to the visitor as we are telling them we can empower them to gather in community


### About:
This page expands on the vision of the group as well as the benefits of joining the group. It explains how joining the group could be beneficial to someone on their journey of improving their mental health

### Bootstrap Cards:
I used Bootstrap cards to make the benefits of join W&T easier to digest for the visitor.

### Contact Page:
Our contact page explains why you should contact us, with a simple form to the right. It has been styled to be elegantly simple, with matching colours. I rounded the edges of the input forms to make them look better. I included a note saying that if anyone is in crisis, to reach out to emergency groups.

### Footer:
This footer included links to all of our social media pages.
