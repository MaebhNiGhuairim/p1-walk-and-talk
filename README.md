# Walk & Talk

See my site here: https://maebhnighuairim.github.io/p1-walk-and-talk/

## Introduction:
I find that getting out and moving is great for my mental health, and so when I saw mental health as a project topic, I knew exactly what I wanted to do. Mental health is a serious issue, and often needs medical and professional intervention, but I believe it’s important not to underestimate the importance of community and activity when treating mental health. So my project is for a local walking group who get together weekly to enjoy some fresh air and conversation.
