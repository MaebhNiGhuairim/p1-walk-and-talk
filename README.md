# Walk & Talk

See my site here: https://maebhnighuairim.github.io/p1-walk-and-talk/

## Introduction:
I find that getting out and moving is great for my mental health, and so when I saw mental health as a project topic, I knew exactly what I wanted to do. Mental health is a serious issue, and often needs medical and professional intervention, but I believe it’s important not to underestimate the importance of community and activity when treating mental health. So my project is for a local walking group who get together weekly to enjoy some fresh air and conversation.


## UXD (User Experience Design) 
### User stories:
1. Easy Navigation: As a visitor, I want to be able to navigate the website easily so that I can access the information I’m looking for.
2. Accessibility: As a visitor, I want the website to be accessible so that I can use it regardless of any disabilities I may have.
3. Welcoming homepage: As a visitor, I want to see a welcoming homepage with information about the purpose of the community walks so that I can understand the benefits of participating.
4. Contact Information: As a visitor, I want to see contact information on the website so that I can reach out to the organizers with any questions or concerns.
5. About Us Page: As a visitor, I want to read an "About Us" page that provides information about the organization and its mission to improve mental health through community walks so that I can learn more about the organization.
6. Photo Gallery: As a visitor, I want to view a photo gallery of past community walks so that I can see what the events are like and feel encouraged to join.
7. Sign-Up Information: As a visitor, I want to see clear instructions on how to sign up for a walk, including any necessary forms or contact details, so that I can easily register for an event.
8. Social Media Links: As a visitor, I want to see links to the organization's social media profiles so that I can follow them for updates and more information.


### Creation process (Strategy -> Surface) 

This is the wireframe for the landing page:

This is the wireframe for the About page:

This is the wireframe for the Contact Us page:

There is no wireframe for the thank you page.


## Design

### Colours:
I chose to focus on the colour green as it is reminiscent of nature and calmness. A deep forest green was my main colour, and I used softer variations across the rest of the pages.

### Typography

I used Google Fonts to customise my fonts across the website. In particular, I used [Sen](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Sen)  and [Edu VIC WA NT Beginner](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Edu+VIC+WA+NT+Beginner). I used the second font mainly for Headings, in all caps, and Sen for the rest of the text.

### Imagery 

I used a mixture of real images and cartoons. I used images that I believe would inspire the user to join the group. The hero image is a group of people walking together towards a clearing in the forest, which is lighter than the darkness of the forest behind. The forest itself is calming too - I instantly want to be trasnported there to be mindful.

Images used in the bootstrap cards are indicative of each benefit proposed in the cards. 

I used cartoons in the landing page to break up walls of text and to have a friendly tone to the text.

I used photos of happy people on walks as images of previous walks. It was important to show diversity in all forms in these photos - all are welcome.


## Page Features

### Navbar 
The responsive navbar features links to Home, About, and Contact Us, designed for both desktop and mobile views. On larger screens, the links are displayed horizontally, while on smaller devices, they collapse into a hamburger menu that expands to show the links vertically when clicked. The navbar has a clean background with contrasting text colors, providing visual feedback on hover. It includes a logo on the left that serves as a home link and is structured to be accessible for all users, ensuring a smooth and user-friendly navigation experience across devices.

### Hero-Image 
Choosing a picture of a group walking through a forest as a hero image for a walking group beautifully captures the essence of community, health, and nature. When looking at the image, I want the visit to envision themselves as part of this uplifting experience, inspiring them to join the group.

### Tagline - “empowering you to get out and talk about mental health”
This tagline is core to the main aims of Walk & Talk - getting a group of people together, out in nature and having a chat. The tagline appeals to the visitor as we are telling them we can empower them to gather in community

### About:
This page expands on the vision of the group as well as the benefits of joining the group. It explains how joining the group could be beneficial to someone on their journey of improving their mental health

### Bootstrap Cards:
I used Bootstrap cards to make the benefits of join W&T easier to digest for the visitor.

### Contact Page:
Our contact page explains why you should contact us, with a simple form to the right. It has been styled to be elegantly simple, with matching colours. I rounded the edges of the input forms to make them look better. I included a note saying that if anyone is in crisis, to reach out to emergency groups.

### Thank you Page:
This page ensures that visitors know their message has been received.

### Footer:
This footer included links to all of our social media pages.

## Future Features 
### Timetable
In the next iteration, I would have a page that included locations, and times of walks. This is a very important feature for a user of this website.

## Testing 
### HTML Validation using W3C Validation

### CSS Validation using W3C Validation

### Lighthouse scores via Chrome Developer Tools 
<img width="850" alt="Screenshot 2024-11-13 at 12 48 19" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a94882ea-75e1-475a-9ad0-1b2972fc1eb2">

Lighthouse was an excellent tool to make my site more accessible, and have better SEO results. I managed to fix many errors I hadn't even noticed I made. However, I struggled to improve my performance score. I believe my hero image is too slow to load, and changed it from png to webp but that didn't help much. In future iterations, I would fix this issue, but as it's very close to deadline, I don't want to disrupt the hero image.

### Unsolved Bugs 

When the contact page is seen on a tablet, the contact instructions and contact box don't sit on top of each other. This leaves a large amount of whitespace at the bottom of the page. This isn't the best user experience, and I spent a lot of time trying to fix it. I have an idead that it's to do with minimum screen heights and the footer being stuck to the bottom of the page. This would be a priority to fix in future iterations.

I reviewed many Code Institute materials to make this website. I especially leaned on their carosel lesson to work on my carosel in my home page.
<br>
I used a lot of Bootstrap to help page responsiveness.
<br>

### Inspiration
I wanted real-life examples of websites that had a good landing page. I found [this website](https://www.hostinger.co.uk/tutorials/information-websites) which gave a few examples of websites that focused on providing information which strong landing pages. 
<br>
I knew green might not be the easiest to design so I wanted to see how others had incorporated green into their websites. I used [this page](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/green-websites) for inspiration.

I used [coolers](https://coolors.co/) to play with different colours and get inspiration about which colour story to go with. 

### Stock images and cartoons

I used Pexels.com and Freepik.com for images and cartoons.
